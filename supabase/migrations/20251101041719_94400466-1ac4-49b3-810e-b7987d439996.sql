-- Phase 77-UF-FIX.7: FK Constraint Deferrable Conversion
-- Purpose: Allow FK validation to be deferred until transaction commit
-- This resolves Replace mode FK violations during DELETE â†’ INSERT sequences

-- Step 1: Drop existing FK constraint
ALTER TABLE public.participants_log
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS participants_log_participant_id_fkey;

-- Step 2: Recreate with DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED
ALTER TABLE public.participants_log
ADD CONSTRAINT participants_log_participant_id_fkey
FOREIGN KEY (participant_id)
REFERENCES public.participants(id)
ON DELETE SET NULL
DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED;

-- Step 3: Verify the change
